    <p class="page-text">
      If you've found your snail unresponsive, still, and possibly stuck inside its shell — don't panic. You're not alone.
      One Reddit user asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snails/comments/12st73n/help_how_long_are_snails_supposed_to_sleep_is_my/" target="_blank">this exact question</a> and sparked a surprisingly wholesome thread.
    </p>

    <p class="page-text">
      Turns out, snails can sleep for a long time. Like, <strong>days</strong>. Some species may go into a kind of hibernation or estivation if the environment isn't right — too dry, too cold, or too warm.
    </p>

    <p class="page-text">
      Top-voted advice? Try gently misting the snail’s tank or placing the snail in a shallow dish of water. Sometimes that’s enough to wake them up. If their body is still soft and retracted, they may just be snoozing.
    </p>

    <p class="page-text">
      Signs that your snail is really gone? A strong smell, a dried-out body, or the trapdoor (operculum) missing or loose.

      "I once thought my snail was dead. Didn't move for 4 days. Then I misted the tank and boom — out it came like nothing happened. They're drama queens."

      "Give it a sniff. If it smells terrible, it's dead. If not, it's probably just chillin’."
