          <p>This site is part of a small personal experiment.<br>
          I’m exploring how we read online — and how hyperlinks quietly shape the way we move through information.<br>
          There’s a short story here, along with a few fragments and reflections.<br>
          It takes around 4–5 minutes to read from start to finish.<br>
          But feel free to move through it however you like – click, scroll, pause, leave halfway, or return later.<br>
          That’s part of it too.<br>
          The site quietly tracks how you navigate through it, only for this project.<br>
          No personal data is collected. You can see what’s being tracked<br> <a href="intro.html" target="_blank">[here]</a>.</p>

        It started with a casual voice note.<br>
        "My latest obsession," my friend said, "is watching videos of wombats. They’re the cutest things ever."<br>
        I paused the audio.  <a href="wombat.html" target="_blank"> Wombats? </a>I had never even heard of them. I thought it might be some kind of tiny animal — like a hamster or something.<br>
        So I did what anyone would do: I googled it.<br>
        I was just planning to check really quickly — maybe look at one photo, get the basic idea.<br>
        But the first thing I saw was this picture of <a href="hugging-wombat.html" target="_blank">a lady hugging an absolutely massive wombat. </a> Like, sofa-sized. That was… unexpected.<br>
        Then I saw a related article headline that said:<a href="wombatpoop.html" target="_blank"> <strong>"Wombats poop cubes."</strong></a><br>
        Excuse me?<br>
        I clicked.<br>
        Apparently yes, wombats are famous for their cube-shaped poop. There was a whole article explaining the biological mechanics of it, with diagrams.<br>
        I scrolled down, and of course — more links: “10 strangest animal digestive facts”, “Why capybaras are everyone’s best friend”, “Otters holding hands compilation”.<br>
        I don’t even remember which one I clicked next. Something soft and furry and blinking at the camera.<br>
        Fifteen minutes later I was watching cats knocking things off shelves. Wombats were long gone.

        <h2>✦ A ROOM MADE OF LINKS</h2>
        <p>
        That’s when I realised... I was lost.<br>
        Not “where-am-I” kind of lost — more like<a href="rabbit.html" target="_blank">“how-did-I-end-up-watching-this-pink-rabbit-eating-a-mini-pancake” </a> kind of lost.<br>
        And the weirdest part? I started out just wanting to know what a wombat was.<br>
        But somewhere between the cube-shaped poop and the capybara friendship facts, I had been... hyperlink-ed.<br>
        It felt like I had opened a tiny door and fallen into a hallway of smaller, shinier doors — each one whispering, <a href="clickme.html" target="_blank">“click me, I’m just one more thing.” </a> <br>
        Which, honestly, kind of worked.
      </p>
    </section>
    </div>

    <section class="hyperlink">
      <p>
        <a href="hyperlink.html" target="_blank">Hyperlinks</a> were meant to connect knowledge —<br>
        to let ideas flow freely across pages, forming a larger conversation.<br>
        But these days, more often than not, they seem to pull me away from what I was actually trying to focus on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes I wonder if it’s really about curiosity…<br>
        or if I’ve just been gently, politely <a href="kidnapped.html" target="_blank">kidnapped by the internet.</a><br>
        It’s not even that I have no self-control (well, okay, maybe a little).<br>
        But there’s something about a blue underlined phrase that invites you to stray.<br>
        Like — are you even supposed to ignore it? It’s right there. Waiting. Sparkly.<br>
        And the thing is, you never really know where you’ll end up.<br>
        Maybe it's a helpful article.<br>
        Maybe it’s an ad pretending to be a helpful article.<br>
        Maybe it’s twenty more links.<br>
        Or maybe it’s a wombat again.<br>
        <div class="quote">
        Who’s really choosing what I see, anyway?</div>

      <section class="end">
        <h2>✦ THIS IS PART OF IT TOO</h2>

      <p>
        That’s kind of why I made this page.<br>
        Not to stop the wandering — honestly, I think the wandering is the best part sometimes —<br>
        But to quietly see (and think about) how we wander.<br>
        How far we drift.<br>
        Whether we ever make it back to where we started…<br>
        or just keep clicking until it’s 2am and we’re reading about <a href="snail.html" target="_blank">how snails sleep.</a><br>
        (Yes. That happened too.)
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s pretty much the end of my little story — a few links, and the internet being its usual mischievous self.<br>
        Maybe you read it straight through.<br>
        Maybe you got completely lost, but somehow made it back.<br>
        Or maybe most people won’t even see this goodbye — lost somewhere along the way here.<br>
        That’s all part of the experiment.<br>
        Because honestly, I don’t think it’s just my reading that’s changed.
